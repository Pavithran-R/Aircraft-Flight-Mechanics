    "This website comprises the course notes for MMAE 410 Aircraft Flight Mechanics - this text originally started as a PDF file written using LaTeX, with links to code and other tidbits. These notes started as my means of ensuring my own competence with the material and, accordingly, they get updated regularly and requiring students to download an updated PDF file every few weeks proved to not be the ideal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now these notes are being transferred into Jupyter notebooks which are bundled together into this document - any changes made to the notes should be reflected in the website within minutes, and this format allows handy things like _interactive content,_ which simply isn't possible (easily) within a PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does mean that my pipedream of getting them published as a textbook is over - but in the spirit of open access and education for all, I'd simply rather that they just got used for their intended purpose. Hence; use these notes to supplement your own learning, and to further your knowledge of the discipline.\n",
