    "# Range and Endurance\n",
    "\n",
    "Range and endurance have been mentioned in the preceding sections - and we have introduced that for *maximum range* the pilot should fly at $V_{md}$, whilst to fly for *maximum endurance* the pilot should fly at $V_{mp}$. Range and endurance are intuitive concepts:\n",
    "- **Range** ($R$): The maximum horizontal distance that an aircraft can cover.\n",
    "- **Endurance** ($E$): The time an aircraft can remain in flight\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following analysis, the range and endurance for certain fuel quantities will be determined. For (hopefully) obvious reasons, some further definitions of range will help us here\n",
    "\n",
    "## Range subdefinitions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Safe Range**: The maximum distance between two airfields, for which an aircraft can fly a safe a reliable mission with a given payload. \n",
    "    - This is an involved calculation involving take-off/landing/weather/diversion allowances etc. - there isn't an easy means to do this calculation, so tends to be performed computationally.\n",
    "    - For aircraft performance there are some more simple definitions of *range*:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Still Air Range (SAR)**: The maximum distance possible if an aircraft takes off, climbs to cruise altitude, and then cruises until all fuel is expended.\n",
    "    - Obviously not desirable to run out of fuel at altitude, but SAR gives a good indication of the influence of aircraft parameters on range.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gross Still Air Range (GSAR)**: The maximum distance possible if an aircraft commences cruise at altitude and continues until all fuel is expended.\n",
    "    - The relationship between SAR and GSAR tends to be easy to define.\n",
    "    - GSAR much easier to calculate\n",
    "    - What will be covered here\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Defining the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate GSAR, you might think that we need to:\n",
    "- find out the fuel flow rate, $\\dot{m}_{fuel}$ for thrust/power associated with $V_{md}$ \n",
    "- get the endurance from the fuel mass, $m_{fuel}$ divided by the flow rate $E=\\frac{m_{fuel}}{\\dot{m}_{fuel}}$\n",
    "- hence $R=E\\cdot V_{md}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above reasoning is effectively how range is determined, but there are some complications that you may/may not be considering:\n",
    "- Aircraft take-off with a *lot* of fuel, so the **aircraft weight changes with time** and accordingly so do almost all the parameters we have considered up to this point\n",
    "- This means that some trade-offs *have* to be made in efficiency to allow a reasonable cruise - and we will see these\n",

    "## Breguet Range Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Breguet Range Equation (BRE) is named after a French aircraft designer, but was actually derived in the 1920's by J G Coffin.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} History and namesakes...\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "I've loosely read the history of the BRE and it being Coffin who actually came up with it in NACA Report 1969, but I've never actually delved into the legacy of this equation. If you wish to, and suggest a correct here, feel free.\n",
    "```\n",
    "The BRE allows a simple means to calculate GSAR, and can be defined in words as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\substack{\\text{\"The rate of}\\\\\\text{aircraft mass reduction\"}}=\\substack{\\text{\"The rate of}\\\\\\text{fuel mass burned\"}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A parameter, $f$, is introduced which is:\n",
    "- Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC) for a **turbojet**\n",
    "    $f$ - **Mass of fuel burned per unit of thrust per second**\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) for a **turboprop**\n",
    "    $f$ - **Mass of fuel burned per unit of power per second**\n",
    "    \n",
    "The analysis is slightly different for jet and propeller-driven aircraft, so jet aircraft will be explored first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BRE - Jet Aircraft\n",
    "\n",
    "With $f$ defined as the *mass of fuel burned per unit of thrust per second*, the SI units are $\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{s}}$, and these are what you *must* use in equation form (if you're using SI units), but $f$ can be defined in other units such as $\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{kN}\\cdot\\text{hr}}$ so you must remember to convert.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BRE for a jet aircraft is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\text{d}W}{\\text{d}t}=-f\\,g\\,T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be rearranged for the time\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{d}t = -\\frac{\\text{d}W}{f\\,g\\,T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "since the endurance/range is defined by *cruise* conditions, the equilibrium steady flight conditions of $T=D$ and $L=W$ can be utilised such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T=\\frac{D}{L}W=\\frac{C_D}{C_L}W$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be substituted into the BRE to give\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{d}t = -\\frac{1}{f\\,g}\\frac{C_L}{C_D}\\frac{\\text{d}W}{W}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for constant lift-to-drag ratio and TSFC, the equation above can be integrated with the limits $t_{end}$ and $t_{start}$ corresponding to $W_{end}$ and $W_{start}$. This yields the endurance, $E$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E=t_{end}-t_{start}=\\frac{1}{f\\,g}\\frac{C_L}{C_D}\\ln\\left|\\frac{W_{start}}{W_{end}}\\right|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and hence the range is given if it is assumed TAS remains constant \n",
    "\n",
    "$$R=\\frac{V}{f\\,g}\\frac{C_L}{C_D}\\ln\\left|\\frac{W_{start}}{W_{end}}\\right|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In developing the above, there have been some *large* assumptions made that have facilitated the derivation. Have a look at these in the dropdown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Implication of our assumptions\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "I've loosely read the history of the BRE and it being Coffin who actually came up with it in NACA Report 1969, but I've never actually delved into the legacy of this equation. If you wish to, and suggest a correct here, feel free.\n",
