    "# Manoeuvres\n",
    "\n",
    "Manoeuvre will be broken down into horizontal and vertical manoeuvres, comprising curvilinear motion. Such manoeuvres are the result of a force *perpendicular* to the flight path, giving a normal acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertical Manoeuvres:\n",
    "- Loop, pull-up, push-over, outside loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal Manoeuvres:\n",
    "- Banked Turn\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the manoevures discussed are the result of a **variation in lift**, which can be *large*. Consider that the dynamic pressure rises with the square of the forward speed, so a five-fold speed increase results in twenty-five times the aerodynamic forces.\n",

    "## Load Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "The load that can be safely taken through an aircraft dictates the load limits on an aircraft - for this the **load factor** is introduced as a non-dimensional measure of the load variation.\n",
