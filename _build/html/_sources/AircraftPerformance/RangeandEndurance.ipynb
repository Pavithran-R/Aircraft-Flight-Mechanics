    "# Range and Endurance\n",
    "\n",
    "Range and endurance have been mentioned in the preceding sections - and we have introduced that for *maximum range* the pilot should fly at $V_{md}$, whilst to fly for *maximum endurance* the pilot should fly at $V_{mp}$. Range and endurance are intuitive concepts:\n",
    "- **Range** ($R$): The maximum horizontal distance that an aircraft can cover.\n",
    "- **Endurance** ($E$): The time an aircraft can remain in flight\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following analysis, the range and endurance for certain fuel quantities will be determined. For (hopefully) obvious reasons, some further definitions of range will help us here\n",
    "\n",
    "## Range subdefinitions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Safe Range**: The maximum distance between two airfields, for which an aircraft can fly a safe a reliable mission with a given payload. \n",
    "    - This is an involved calculation involving take-off/landing/weather/diversion allowances etc. - there isn't an easy means to do this calculation, so tends to be performed computationally.\n",
    "    - For aircraft performance there are some more simple definitions of *range*:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Still Air Range (SAR)**: The maximum distance possible if an aircraft takes off, climbs to cruise altitude, and then cruises until all fuel is expended.\n",
    "    - Obviously not desirable to run out of fuel at altitude, but SAR gives a good indication of the influence of aircraft parameters on range.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gross Still Air Range (GSAR)**: The maximum distance possible if an aircraft commences cruise at altitude and continues until all fuel is expended.\n",
    "    - The relationship between SAR and GSAR tends to be easy to define.\n",
    "    - GSAR much easier to calculate\n",
    "    - What will be covered here\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Defining the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate GSAR, you might think that we need to:\n",
    "- find out the fuel flow rate, $\\dot{m}_{fuel}$ for thrust/power associated with $V_{md}$ \n",
    "- get the endurance from the fuel mass, $m_{fuel}$ divided by the flow rate $E=\\frac{m_{fuel}}{\\dot{m}_{fuel}}$\n",
    "- hence $R=E\\cdot V_{md}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above reasoning is effectively how range is determined, but there are some complications that you may/may not be considering:\n",
    "- Aircraft take-off with a *lot* of fuel, so the **aircraft weight changes with time** and accordingly so do almost all the parameters we have considered up to this point\n",
    "- This means that some trade-offs *have* to be made in efficiency to allow a reasonable cruise - and we will see these\n",
    "\n",
    "## Breguet Range Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Breguet Range Equation (BRE) is named after a French aircraft designer, but was actually derived in the 1920's by J G Coffin.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} History and namesakes...\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "I've loosely read the history of the BRE and it being Coffin who actually came up with it in NACA Report 1969, but I've never actually delved into the legacy of this equation. If you wish to, and suggest a correct here, feel free.\n",
    "```\n",
    "The BRE allows a simple means to calculate GSAR, and can be defined in words as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\substack{\\text{\"The rate of}\\\\\\text{aircraft mass reduction\"}}=\\substack{\\text{\"The rate of}\\\\\\text{fuel mass burned\"}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A parameter, $f$, is introduced which is:\n",
    "- Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC) for a **turbojet**\n",
    "    $f$ - **Mass of fuel burned per unit of thrust per second**\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) for a **turboprop**\n",
    "    $f$ - **Mass of fuel burned per unit of power per second**\n",
    "    \n",
    "The analysis is slightly different for jet and propeller-driven aircraft, so jet aircraft will be explored first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BRE - Jet Aircraft\n",
    "\n",
    "With $f$ defined as the *mass of fuel burned per unit of thrust per second*, the SI units are $\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{s}}$, and these are what you *must* use in equation form (if you're using SI units), but $f$ can be defined in other units such as $\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{kN}\\cdot\\text{hr}}$ so you must remember to convert.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BRE for a jet aircraft is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\text{d}W}{\\text{d}t}=-f\\,g\\,T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be rearranged for the time\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{d}t = -\\frac{\\text{d}W}{f\\,g\\,T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "since the endurance/range is defined by *cruise* conditions, the equilibrium steady flight conditions of $T=D$ and $L=W$ can be utilised such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T=\\frac{D}{L}W=\\frac{C_D}{C_L}W$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be substituted into the BRE to give\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{d}t = -\\frac{1}{f\\,g}\\frac{C_L}{C_D}\\frac{\\text{d}W}{W}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for constant lift-to-drag ratio and TSFC, the equation above can be integrated with the limits $t_{end}$ and $t_{start}$ corresponding to $W_{end}$ and $W_{start}$. This yields the endurance, $E$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E=t_{end}-t_{start}=\\frac{1}{f\\,g}\\frac{C_L}{C_D}\\ln\\left|\\frac{W_{start}}{W_{end}}\\right|$$\n",

    "### What maximises range?\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation above gives the design/mission choices that help maximise range:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is the BRE utilised?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Breguet Range Equation, Equation {eq}`BRE`, some parameters are dictated by the problem:\n",
    "- $W_{start}$ is the weight of the aircraft including fuel\n",
    "- $W_{end}$ is the weight of the aircraft with no fuel, or with a certain mandated reserve\n",
    "- $f$ is the TSFC and will generally be given in a problem\n",
    "- $g$ is accleration due to gravity, and since you're an aerospace engineer you should use $g=9.80665\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}^{2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "*When I was an undergrad...*\n",
    "\n",
    "...we went through deriving $g$ using Newton's law of gravitation - due to the size of this course, there isn't enough room. [Have a look here instead](https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/-/gravity-in-detail-5728).\n",
    "```\n",
    "Other parameters are unknown - so $V$, $C_L$, and $C_D$ need to be *constrained* (defined in terms of other parameters) in order to use Equation {eq}`BRE` to determine the possible range.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these cases, the *range function* is replaced with something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../Images/RangeFunction.png\n",
    "---\n",
    "height: 300px\n",
    "name: RangeFunction\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    "The 'range function' is the expression $V\\frac{C_L}{C_D}$ and clearly maximum range is given by the maximum value thereof.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this means replacing $V\\frac{C_L}{C_D}$ with an equivalent expression representing the variation of the parameters therein, by finding another means of representing $V$ as a function of $C_L$ or $C_D$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three different means of doing this will be explored:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Most Efficient - Cruise Climb\n",
    "\n",
    "The most aerodynamically efficient cruise would be with constant best $C_L/C_D$, and constant $f$. These have some implications. Have a look at these in the dropdown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Implication of the most efficient cruise\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, it was stipulated that the lift-to-drag ratio ($C_L/C_D$), TSFC $f$, and $V_{T}$ were constant. These assumptions have some implications:\n",
    "- Fuel burn causes a reduction in aircraft weight - so as $W$ drops, the dimensional value of lift, $L$, must also drop ($L=W$)\n",
    "- Since TAS is constant, for $L$ to drop, either $C_L$ must drop or $\\sigma$ must reduce\n",
    "    - But it was also assumed that the aircraft flies at the best aerodynamic efficiency, and that $C_L/C_D$ was constant, which implies a constant angle of attack\n",
    "    - Therefore, $\\sigma$ must reduce, and hence **altitude must increase** for an efficient cruise\n",
    "- As $C_L$ reduces, for constant $C_L/C_D$, $C_D$ must reduce in proportion to $\\sigma$ also\n",
    "    - Since $T=D$, the thrust must reduce with altitude\n",
    "    - For constant TSFC, $f$, the **throttle setting must be constant**\n",
    "    - Hence thrust must be modelled from $T=T_{SL}\\cdot\\sigma^n$ with $n=1$\n",
    "    - As discussed previously, $n$ is dependent on altitude and engine type - and the thrust model above is a vast simplification *anyway*\n",
    "    - $n=1$ is more suitable in the *stratosphere* (above 11km-ish), where the temperature falls with altitude (slightly more complicated than this, but it works enough for us).\n",
    "    - Below 11km, in the *troposphere*, the temperature falls with altitude - and hence $n<1$, so thrust falls less rapidly with altitude. To maintain constant $C_L/C_D$ requires the pilot to reduce the throttle to maintain $V$ or $C_L$, which would change the TSFC\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The derivation has arrived at the so-called *cruise-climb* case, whereby the aircraft altitude rises along the cruise to maintain peak aerodynamic efficiency. This is infrequently allowed by air traffic control - but aircraft often follow a stepped-climb, which is a planned series of altitude changes to allow some of the benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further to the above, two cruise-climb cases can be explored:\n",
    "1. **Throttle Restricted** - The throttle setting is *fixed*, and the aircraft must vary altitude to maintain constant $C_L/C_D$\n",
    "2. **Throttle Unrestricted** - The throttle can be altered to maintain constant $C_L/C_D$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cruise-Climb 1: Throttle Restricted\n",
    "\n",
    "'Throttle-restricted' means that the throttle is kept constant, and the maximum range therefore depends on the variation of thrust with altitude, hence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$T=T_{sl}\\cdot\\sigma$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the variation of altitude is unknown, $T=D$ will be used to develop an expression for $V$ that does not contain $\\sigma$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}T &= T_{sl}\\cdot\\sigma\\\\\n",
    "&= D\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "and hence velocity can be represented in terms of constants and the drag coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\implies V=\\sqrt{\\frac{T_{sl}}{\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\rho_{sl}\\,S\\,C_D}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so the range function becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V\\,\\frac{C_L}{C_D}=\\sqrt{\\frac{T_{sl}}{\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\rho_{sl}\\,S\\,C_D}}\\frac{C_L}{C_D}$$\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So for **maximum range for throttle restricted cruise climb** $\\frac{C_L}{C_D^{3/2}}$ must be maximised. In practice it is easier to minimise the reciprocal - inserting the drag equation:\n",
