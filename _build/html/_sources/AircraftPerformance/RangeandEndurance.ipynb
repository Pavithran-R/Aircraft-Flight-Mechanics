    "Range and endurance have been mentioned in the preceding sections - and we have introduced that for *maximum range* the pilot should fly at $V_{md}$, whilst to fly for *maximum endurance* the pilot should fly at $V_{mp}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However - the above speeds are valid **only for unpowered flight**. So these speeds are suitable for a glider, but once an engine is introduced to an aircraft, these speeds no longer give the maximum range or the maximum endurance.\n",

    "# Range and Endurance\n",
    "\n",
    "Range and endurance are intuitive concepts:\n",
    "- **Range** ($R$): The maximum horizontal distance that an aircraft can cover.\n",
    "- **Endurance** ($E$): The time an aircraft can remain in flight\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following analysis, the range and endurance for certain fuel quantities will be determined. For (hopefully) obvious reasons, some further definitions of range will help us here\n",
    "\n",
    "## Range subdefinitions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Safe Range**: The maximum distance between two airfields, for which an aircraft can fly a safe a reliable mission with a given payload. \n",
    "    - This is an involved calculation involving take-off/landing/weather/diversion allowances etc. - there isn't an easy means to do this calculation, so tends to be performed computationally.\n",
    "    - For aircraft performance there are some more simple definitions of *range*:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Still Air Range (SAR)**: The maximum distance possible if an aircraft takes off, climbs to cruise altitude, and then cruises until all fuel is expended.\n",
    "    - Obviously not desirable to run out of fuel at altitude, but SAR gives a good indication of the influence of aircraft parameters on range.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gross Still Air Range (GSAR)**: The maximum distance possible if an aircraft commences cruise at altitude and continues until all fuel is expended.\n",
    "    - The relationship between SAR and GSAR tends to be easy to define.\n",
    "    - GSAR much easier to calculate\n",
    "    - What will be covered here\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Defining the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate GSAR, you might think that we need to:\n",
    "- find out the fuel flow rate, $\\dot{m}_{fuel}$ for thrust/power associated with $V_{md}$ \n",
    "- get the endurance from the fuel mass, $m_{fuel}$ divided by the flow rate $E=\\frac{m_{fuel}}{\\dot{m}_{fuel}}$\n",
    "- hence $R=E\\cdot V$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above reasoning is effectively how range is determined, but there are some complications that you may/may not be considering:\n",
    "- Aircraft take-off with a *lot* of fuel, so the **aircraft weight changes with time** and accordingly so do almost all the parameters we have considered up to this point, including the aircraft speed whilst the above relationship only holds true for *constant* airspeed\n",
    "- This means that some trade-offs *have* to be made in efficiency to allow a reasonable cruise - and we will see these\n",

    "## Breguet Range Equation\n",

    "The Breguet Range Equation (BRE) is named after a French aircraft designer, but was actually derived in the 1920's by J G Coffin.\n",

    "```\n",
    "The BRE allows a simple means to calculate GSAR, and can be defined in words as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\substack{\\text{\"The rate of}\\\\\\text{aircraft weight reduction\"}}=\\substack{\\text{\"The rate of}\\\\\\text{fuel weight burned\"}}$$\n",

    "To calculate the engine fuel burn of both types of engine, two new parameters are introduced\n",
