    "The discipline of Aircraft Flight Mechanics requires the formulation of relationships between aircraft forces, and aircraft motion. In order to define *motion*, it was necessary to define the different airspeeds in the preceding section.\n",

    "Aircraft have six degrees of freedom - three translational ($x, y, z$), and three rotational ($\\phi, \\theta, \\psi$), and in order to develop the expressions describing aicraft flight, *nine* coupled equations are required. This course will get to that point, and those equations will derived and utilised - but before that, some really handy relationships can be defined for flight constrained to a single direction.\n",
