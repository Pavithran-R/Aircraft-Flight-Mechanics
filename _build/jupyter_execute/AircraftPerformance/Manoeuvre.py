*(Note: the US spelling is maneuver, but it took me years of muscle memory training to spell manoeuvre correctly, and I won't be losing it easily.)*

# Manoeuvres

Manoeuvre will be broken down into horizontal and vertical manoeuvres, comprising curvilinear motion. Such manoeuvres are the result of a force *perpendicular* to the flight path, giving a normal acceleration.

Vertical Manoeuvres:
- Loop, pull-up, push-over, outside loop

Horizontal Manoeuvres:
- Banked Turn

All of the manoevures discussed are the result of a **variation in lift**, which can be *large*. Consider that the dynamic pressure rises with the square of the forward speed, so a five-fold speed increase results in twenty-five times the aerodynamic forces.

## Load Factor

The load that can be safely taken through an aircraft dictates the load limits on an aircraft - for this the **load factor** is introduced as a non-dimensional measure of the load variation.

```{admonition} So - *what is the load factor for steady level flight?*
An example of an admonition with a title.
